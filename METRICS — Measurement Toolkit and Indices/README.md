# upc-research
This component contains the full set of measurement tools and 
indices used within the UPC framework. It defines and explains 
all core metrics including CA, XAS, ECAS, RDM, RQ, ROM, and 
SVA and provides rating manuals, calculation methods, and 
conceptual foundations for each index. These resources 
establish the standardized measurement system that allows UPC 
theories to be evaluated, compared, and 
applied consistently across all domains and empirical studies.

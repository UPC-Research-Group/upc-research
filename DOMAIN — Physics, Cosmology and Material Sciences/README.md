# upc-research
This component explores how UPC principles apply to physics, 
cosmology, and material sciences. It includes theoretical 
extensions, reinterpretations of physical systems, quantum 
foundations, cosmological models, and matter-level dynamics 
through the lens of Universal Awareness and resonance-based 
laws. These documents demonstrate how UPC concepts can inform, 
refine, or challenge 
existing scientific paradigms within the physical sciences.

🔵 To get DOI or identify your Zenodo DOI → You MUST create an OSF Registration

Here’s how:

✔ Step 1 — Open your OSF project
✔ Step 2 — Click “Registrations” tab

(top of your project page)

✔ Step 3 — Click “New Registration”
✔ Step 4 — Choose any template:

OSF Preregistration

AsPredicted

Open-Ended Registration
(Choose Open-Ended Registration if this is just a paper)

✔ Step 5 — Continue → Review → Register
✔ Step 6 — Hit Publish (when ready)

After it is finalized:

🔥 OSF does two things:

Creates a DOI for the registration

Shows the Identifier Section where you can list:

related DOIs

your Zenodo DOI

datasets DOIs

external links

Now you will see the “Identifiers” card.

🔵 If you ONLY want to show your Zenodo DOI inside OSF (without OSF minting its own DOI)

Then do this:

📌 You must still create a Registration

but you can change the visibility to “Public” or keep it private.

Inside the registration:

Go to Metadata

You will now see Identifiers

Add:

DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17766880

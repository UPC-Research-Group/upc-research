This component applies UPC principles to medicine, health, 
and wellbeing. It explores resonance-based models of 
physiology, integrative health approaches, clinical 
implications of UPC metrics, and the relationship between 
coherence, adaptation, and health outcomes. These documents 
demonstrate how UPC can inform diagnostics, therapeutic 
strategies, and holistic understanding of human health.

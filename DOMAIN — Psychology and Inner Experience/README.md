# upc-research
This component explores the psychological and experiential 
dimensions of UPC. It includes applications to consciousness 
studies, phenomenology, inner development, meditation practices, 
and Resonance Optimization Practices (ROPs). These documents 
examine how UPC principles illuminate subjective experience, 
cognitive dynamics, emotional patterns, 
and the processes of inner transformation and attunement.

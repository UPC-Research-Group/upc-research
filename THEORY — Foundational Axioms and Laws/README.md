# upc-research
This component contains the core theoretical foundations of 
the Unified Play of Consciousness (UPC). It includes the 
fundamental axioms, laws, and ontological structures that 
define concepts such as Universal Awareness (UA), Universal 
Intelligence (UI), the Universal Field (UF), and the 
intrinsic–extrinsic polarities. These documents establish the 
primary scientific architecture on which 
all UPC metrics, applications, and empirical studies are built.

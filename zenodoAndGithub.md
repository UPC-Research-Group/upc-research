How Zenodo Displays a Research Paper

Zenodo never renders:

PDF inside the webpage

HTML version of your paper

Interactive formatted article view

Instead, Zenodo provides:

A metadata page (title, authors, abstract, DOI)

Your PDF/DOCX files as downloadable attachments

This is completely normal and expected.
Zenodo is an open-access repository, not a journal publisher.

📌 Do You Need to Create an HTML File?

❌ No — you are not required to create HTML.
Zenodo does not use HTML articles.

Your paper is still considered a “published research output” as long as:

You uploaded your PDF

You added metadata (title, authors, abstract)

You published the record

Zenodo assigned a DOI

This is already a valid publication.

🟦 How to Make Your Paper Look More Professional on Zenodo

If your goal is to make the paper look like a proper “publication”, you should do this:

✔ Step 1: Upload your PDF

This is your main paper.

✔ Step 2: Fill metadata correctly:

Title

Authors

Affiliations

Description / Abstract

Keywords

License (e.g., CC BY 4.0)

Publication date

✔ Step 3: Select “Publication → Article”

In Zenodo metadata, set:

Upload Type: Publication
Publication Type: Article


This makes Zenodo classify it as a research article instead of just a dataset or file.

🟦 Optional: If you want your paper viewable online

Zenodo cannot do this.
But you have two optional alternatives:

Option A — Host an HTML version on GitHub Pages

Steps:

Convert your PDF → HTML (I can help you generate this)

Add it to your GitHub repo as index.html

Enable GitHub Pages

Link that webpage in Zenodo’s “related identifiers”

This gives you:

Zenodo = archive + DOI

GitHub Pages = online readable version

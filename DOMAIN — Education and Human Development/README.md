# upc-research
This component examines how UPC principles apply to learning, 
development, and educational systems. It includes models of 
human growth, ECAS/XAS-based learning processes, cognitive 
development frameworks, and resonance-guided approaches to 
teaching and curriculum design. These documents show how UPC 
concepts can enhance educational practice, support developmental pathways, 
and improve individual and collective learning outcomes.

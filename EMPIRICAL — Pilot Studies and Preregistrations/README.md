# upc-research
This component contains all empirical work designed to test 
UPC principles. It includes pilot studies, experimental protocols, 
preregistrations, hypotheses, failure conditions, measurement 
procedures, and planned analyses. These documents provide the 
scientific foundation for validating or falsifying UPC metrics 
and models 
through transparent, reproducible, and openly shared research.

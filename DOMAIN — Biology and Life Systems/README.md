# upc-research
This component applies UPC principles to biological and 
ecological systems. It examines life processes, plant 
intelligence, evolutionary patterns, microbiological behavior, 
and ecosystem dynamics through the framework of Universal 
Awareness and resonance-based adaptation. These documents show 
how UPC concepts can offer new interpretations of growth, 
regulation, 
cooperation, and intelligence across living systems.
